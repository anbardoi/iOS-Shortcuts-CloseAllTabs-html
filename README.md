# **Close all tabs in Safari at once**

Simple html page to automatically run any shortcut titled ‘Close Tabs’ on your iOS device. Pretty much only created this because I'm sick of swiping all my tabs away on Safari. You can fork this repository, create a github pages site and save the site to your favorites(in Safari) which you can display on Safari start page. As long as you have a shortcut titled 'Close Tabs' on your iPhone it will run that shortcut right from your Safari start page.

iCloud link to 'Close Tabs' shortcut I made:

Github Pages link for this repository that will run the shortcut from Safari:
https://anbardoi.github.io/iOS-Shortcuts-CloseAllTabs-html/

After getting the shortcut installed and navigating to the above site, iOS will prompt you to open the github page in Shortcuts. For the first time, click 'Cancel'. It will just be a blank web page, but add it to your favorites, and display favorites on your Safari start page. Boom, you have a close all tabs shortcut. right there in safari. It's a wonder isn't it?
